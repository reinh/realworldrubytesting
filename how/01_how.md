Good Tests
==================================

* **Fast Focused Feedback**
* Slow tests won't get run enough
* Test one thing at a time
* Localize problems quickly
* Minimize distance between test and code

Testing Smells
==============

* State leak
* Long setup code
* Setup duplication
* Long running tests
* Fragile tests

!SLIDE incremental bullets

Testing Practices
==============

* Isolation
* Test List
* Regression Tests
* First Test
* Mocking and Stubbing

How Do We Test
==============

* Red Green Refactor
* Using Feedback

!SLIDE bullets

Red Green Refactor
==================

* Quickly add a test from your list.
* See the test fail.
* Make a change.
* See the test succeed.
* Refactor to remove duplication.

Using Feedback
==============

* What's the smallest testable increment  
  of functionality?
* How small should the tests and changes be?
* How often should the tests be run?
* How many steps should the refactor take?
